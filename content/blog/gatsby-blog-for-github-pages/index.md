I have personal project that I've wanted to start for a while, and felt that it could be beneficial to start a small blog where I can capture some of my thoughts. I will cover that project in the next post, but wanted to begin with some information about the setup of the blog itself.

I've opted to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting, primarily because it's simple and free. An added benefit is that it uses a GitHub repository for source control and GitHub Actions for a continuous deployment pipeline.

For the content itself, I've utilised [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and specifically the [gatsby-starter-blog](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) template. I have some familiarity with Gatsby from a project last year, where I used it to create a quiz that I hosted with interactive media components. The framework provides some good quality of life features such as templating, and markdown to HTML conversion, without being overly complicated for my needs.
