At some point last year, I stumbled upon [The Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) and saved the link to revisit when I had the chance. To summarise, the challenge entails creating your resume (or curriculum vitae) as a web page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Then, using DevOps methodologies and technologies, deploying the resume to a cloud service provider.

Several aspects of the challenge resonate with my professional interests.

Firstly, while I don't consider myself to be a talented web designer, I feel that I've attained a level of competence from some of my personal projects over the past few years. I appreciate the control over layout and styling afforded by HTML and CSS and being able to use responsive web design techniques seems beneficial, for example, providing a better user experience on a mobile device. Having this kind of document under source control, with change history tracking, seems like it could be interesting.

Secondly, I am keen on expanding my knowledge in cloud engineering and DevOps. I have some exposure from my previous and current employment, but more can only help. The Cloud Resume Challenge provides a few variants, covering different cloud service providers or advanced technologies; While I possess more experience with Microsoft Azure, I am eager to dedicate more time with AWS so I will follow [The Cloud Resume Challenge - AWS](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/).

Finally, the obvious benefit to this challenge is the outcome. Having a resume available online which is easy to share and easy to maintain should help with career opportunities. The learning and experience from the project can hopefully be used throughout my career, and it also makes a great talking point and provides examples to be used in future interviews.
